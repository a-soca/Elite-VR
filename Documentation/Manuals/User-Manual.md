## Installation

> Note: Elite VR has been built and tested on Windows 10 with a Meta Quest 2/3. Users on different platforms and versions may have varying results attempting to run this game.

> Flight Stick Users: This game has been designed for the VKB Gladiator NXT flight stick; however, the main axis and firing controls have been made generic for compatibility. Users of different flight sticks can access all non-generic controls by using the left quest controller alongside the flight stick.

### Prerequisites
Please ensure you have installed Meta Quest Link on your computer and configured either Air Link or the Link Cable prior to starting the game.


To install EliteVR, download the latest release from the Github page [here](https://github.com/a-soca/Elite-VR/releases/latest)


After the download has complete, unpack the zip file to the desired directory. To run the game, simply double click StartEliteVR.bat and allow access to the network on the Windows Firewall dialogue box. Another pop up will appear requesting to copy files to your Documents directory which you must accept.

 
## Basic Controls
You can find the control mapping diagrams [here](/Documentation/Manuals/Controls.md).
 

## Gameplay
### Start Scene
When you first load into the game, you will find yourself in your living room, greeted by your BBC Micro. To your right, you will notice a mysterious 5.25-inch disk on the desk. Using either the controllers or your bare hands, pick up this disk and insert it into the disk reader. 

![Disk](/Assets/Images/User-Manual/1-Disk.png)

Once your Micro has started running the disk, you must click the keys as directed to load Elite.

> Tip: Brace yourself for what comes next!


### Entering Elite VR
Once you have been enigmatically transported into the zero-page memory space of your BBC Micro, touch the rotating Elite badge in front of you to enter your Cobra MKIII.

![Touch To Start](/Assets/Images/User-Manual/3-Touch-To-Start.png)


### Meeting Your Cobra MKIII
Initially, you will find yourself docked in the home space station. Take a moment to familiarise yourself with the ship’s control layout. Directly in front of you, the Critical Information Panel displays what you need to stay alive in the vast expanses of space. To your left, you will notice a wide array of buttons and your BBC Micro screen on the Computer Panel. Finally, to your right you will see a floating orb (your 3D Scanner) and three bars (your ship’s Telemetry).

Your ship is also equipped with a Heads Up Display (HUD), but while your ship is safe and sound docked in the station, you won’t be able to see this.

While docked, you can access options unavailable in flight, including Buying, Selling and Equipping your Ship. Further information on this aspect of the game can be found in the [Trading](#trading) section of this document.
 

#### The Critical Information Panel

![Critical Info](/Assets/Images/User-Manual/4-Critical-Info-Panel.png) 

The Critical Information Panel consists of 3 buttons and some information bars that are required for survival in space.


##### Launch Button
This button will allow you to exit the station if you are docked or otherwise switch your computer screen to the front view.

> Tip: Since you are trapped in the BBC Micro, your actions are constrained by the computer. Although you can navigate as normal while you are in the menus of the Computer Panel, the BBC Micro will not check to see if your lasers are pointed at an enemy ship; even if it looks like you are hitting it! Make sure you press the Launch button to switch to the front view while in combat.


##### Dock Button
The Dock button will activate the docking computer to automatically dock your ship. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the music while the computer does the work.


##### Jump Button
Once you are comfortable enough to venture beyond the Safe Zone, open the short-range map on the Computer Panel, move the cursor to select a planet in range, and press this button to activate your hyperdrive. 
Tip: It will take 15 seconds to spin up the drive and enter Hyperspace; try to be pre-emptive if you are trying to use the Hyperdrive to escape enemies.


##### Shields
Your ship is equipped with a Front and Aft shield. These will deplete before your energy starts to decrease from enemy fire. The shield graphic in the top right corner of the Critical Information Panel will show you the status of your shields at a glance:

```
Green  : = 100%
Yellow : < 100%
Red    : <  40%
White  : <   2%
```

Your shields will recharge over time, so don’t worry too much if you scratch your paint on an asteroid. It should be noted that your Energy Banks will not recharge if your shields are below 100%.


##### Energy Banks
The ship is equipped with 4 energy banks. When these die, so will you. They regenerate over time but in exchange, firing your lasers, using your ECM and a multiplicity of other things will deplete them, so keep an eye on how they are doing during combat.

If the energy banks start to deplete, you might notice some sparks. If you continue abusing them or taking damage from enemies, your interior lights will flash red to let you know that you need to escape ASAP.

![Low Energy](/Assets/Images/User-Manual/5-Energy-Low.png)


##### Fuel Volume
Jumping through Hyperspace doesn’t get the best fuel economy; you should monitor the fuel volume bar to make sure you don’t overextend your ships range. You can purchase a fuel scoop to use stars as a fuel source or otherwise purchase fuel from stations while docked.


##### Cabin Temperature
The cabin temperature will increase as you approach stars, and your energy will start to take a hit as you overheat. Try to keep this in check if you are navigating close to stars while using a fuel scoop


##### Laser Temperature
Firing your laser for too long will start to cause your energy to deplete significantly and the firing rate to decrease. Keep the temperature sensible to avoid this.


##### Altitude
The distance between you and the nearest planet’s surface. Don’t get too close for obvious reasons.


### The Computer Panel
Your trusty Beeb is the home for navigation and trading. While docked, you will have access to three extra pages, the keypad and y/n buttons to interact with trading menus.

![Computer Panel](/Assets/Images/User-Manual/6-Computer-Panel.png)


#### Long Range
This page shows you the galactic chart. You will be unable to explore this until you have upgraded your Hyperdrive.


#### Short Range
The short-range chart shows you nearby systems. You can move the cursor with the left thumb stick or secondary axis on the flight stick. Hover over the planet you wish to jump to and use the Jump Button to enter Hyperspace. You can also use the system information page to gather information on the system selected.

> Tip: The large circle indicates the maximum range you are able to jump with your current fuel volume, however you should be aware that this does not account for the journey home. Make sure you don’t venture too far just because you can!


#### System Data
This page displays information about the currently selected system. You can use this information to better inform you of trading decisions and to avoid (or seek) dangerous areas.


#### Market Prices
You can take a look at the current system’s market prices using this screen.


#### Status Mode
Status Mode shows you the equipment on your ship as well as your commander profile.

#### Cabin Storage
The Cabin Storage page displays the contents of your cargo hold. You can sell this when docked using the Sell Cargo page.


### Trading
> Tip: You can only access trading pages while docked. Make sure you find a system with a good market to dock at to make your credits go further.
Buy Cargo

Enter the Buy Cargo page and click enter on the keypad until you find the item you are looking for. You can then use the keypad to specify the quantity and press enter to confirm.


#### Sell Cargo
Selling cargo is as easy as clicking the sell button and confirming with the Y key next to the keypad. If you don’t like the offer provided, click the N button to cancel the sale.


#### Equip Ship
You can equip your ship with plenty of extra functions to make your journeys more comfortable or destructive. For now, you only have 100 Credits so try to be budget conscious.

> Tip: By default, Elite VR will handily provide you with a docking computer and ECM System free of charge as compensation for being trapped in a computer from 1981. That’s 1600 Credits worth of value!


### The Heads Up Display (HUD)
The heads up display provides vital indications that help you keep your eyes on the… Stars. Below is a capture of all the indications available to you, although you most likely won’t be seeing them all at once unless something has gone seriously wrong. 

![HUD](/Assets/Images/User-Manual/7-HUD.png)


#### Missile Counter
The four green squares in the bottom right of your crosshair indicate how many missiles are currently loaded on your ship.


#### Targeting Active/Target Locked
If you have activated your missiles, they will start searching for a target. Once you have pointed your crosshairs at an enemy ship, the Target Locked indicator will let you know that it’s time to shoot.


#### ECM Active
What if the enemy has missiles too? Not to worry. The Electronic Countermeasure System (ECM) blasts a powerful wave of electromagnetic interference which causes missiles in the area to explode prematurely, at a cost of your energy. This indicator will light up if this system is currently active.

> Tip: The ECM has a cooldown timer; timing is key to avoid depleting your energy twice when trying to counter missiles. Additionally, try not to use the ECM after firing a missile as it will also destroy friendly ones!


#### Energy Low
This warning will appear if your ship is in critical condition. When you see this on the HUD, you may need to cut your losses and leave immediately.


#### Hyperdrive Charging
The hyperdrive indicator will light up when you are about to enter hyperspace. It will take 15 seconds to enter the jump from when you start charging.


#### Docking Computer On
Your BBC Micro is handling the parking.


### The 3D Scanner
Your radar is able to show the position and orientation of all ships, stations and obstacles in the area on the 3D Scanner. This can be used to help with docking and combat to check where ships are in relation to your view. The colours displayed are different to those of the ships outside to help you identify different categories easily.

![3D Scanner](/Assets/Images/User-Manual/8-Radar.png)

> Tip: The yellow cone roughly indicates your field of view to help you orient your ship at targets.

# Troubleshooting
## My BBC Micro Screen is White
You will have a white computer screen in VR if the game cannot locate the BeebEm window. This will usually happen if you do not have BeebEm open, which likely happened as a result of launching `EliteVR.exe` directly instead of using `StartEliteVR.bat`. Close the game and double click `StartEliteVR.bat` to correctly run the game.

## I am Stuck in the Floor / Across the Room
Follow the guidelines of your specific headset for recentering your position. Make sure you have correctly configured your guardian and calibrated the playspace prior to starting the game. If you are still in an unexpected location, disconnect your headset from link, close the game and restart. This will force an offset recalibration.

## My Virtual Keyboard Doesn’t Work
If you have not enabled permission for Elite VR to use your local network, the Unity component won’t be able to communicate with BeebEm. Please either use your system settings to change the permissions for Elite VR or just unzip the game again and run it to be prompted again.

## BeebEm Failed to Load Disk
This error will occur when BeebEm cannot find the Elite disk when you try to insert it. To fix this, place the disk back into the root directory of the game folder in the same location as the `StartEliteVR.bat` file you use to play the game.
